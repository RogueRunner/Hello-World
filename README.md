# Hello-World
learning Github
Currently feel as though I'm too late to the party for Occipital's Bridge Engine and MR headset. Only recently stumble over the fact that something like that even exixted but unfortantly for some reason it has suddenly been discontinued due to a hardware/sensor update. Even they no longer supported the product they left a note on their website saying that the Bridge Engine was still available on a Github repository for download. Im here to find out what that actually means and if its worth my time or not
